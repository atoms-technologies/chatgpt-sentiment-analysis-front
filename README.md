# Frontend ReactJS Application for Sentimental Analysis

This ReactJS application serves as the frontend for the NodeJS backend application [chatgpt-sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/atoms-technologies/chatgpt-sentiment-analysis), allowing users to interact with the sentimental analysis functionality provided by the backend. The frontend will be developed in phases, corresponding to the phases defined in the backend application.

## Phase 1: Document Upload and Sentimental Analysis

In this phase, we will create a basic ReactJS application that allows users to upload Word documents and initiate sentimental analysis using the NodeJS backend APIs.

### Features to Implement in Phase 1:

1. Create Project: Set up a new ReactJS project using Create React App or any preferred boilerplate.

2. Home Page: Design a simple and intuitive home page that allows users to access the upload functionality.

3. File Upload: Implement a file upload component that allows users to select and upload Word documents.

4. API Integration: Integrate with the NodeJS backend APIs for document upload and sentimental analysis.

5. Display Results: Show the analysis results returned by the backend on the frontend after analysis completion.

## Phase 2: Authentication, Storage, and Database Integration

In this phase, we will enhance the ReactJS application to include user authentication and provide users with access to their analysis records.

### Features to Implement in Phase 2:

1. User Authentication: Create login and signup components for user authentication.

2. Access Control: Implement logic to allow only authenticated users to access the document upload and analysis functionality.

3. User Dashboard: Design a dashboard page that displays a list of all the analysis records associated with the authenticated user.

4. Analysis Details: Implement a feature to view the details of a specific analysis record.

## Phase 3: User Management

In this phase, we will expand the ReactJS application to include user management features.

### Features to Implement in Phase 3:

1. Change Password: Allow users to change their passwords from within the application.

2. Password Reset: Provide a "Forgot Password" functionality where users can request a password reset and receive an email with an updated password.

3. Profile Picture Upload: Create a component that allows users to upload a profile picture, which will be stored in AWS S3.

## Conclusion

By completing all phases, you will have developed a fully functional ReactJS frontend application that works seamlessly with the NodeJS backend application. Users can upload Word documents, initiate sentimental analysis, view their analysis records, and perform user management tasks.

Keep in mind that these phases align with the backend phases, ensuring a systematic development process for both frontend and backend applications.
